# todoListApp
Android app that lets you create a todo list and set alarms to each of the things that you want to do

- after you create an item if you leave it pressed it will get deleted that way if you completed something already you can take it off the list
- after you create an item you also have the option of giving the item that you just created an alarm so that you can be reminded
